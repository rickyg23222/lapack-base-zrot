Welcome to the LAPACK Base Zrot repository! This repository contains LAPACK's auxiliary routine to apply a plane rotation with real cosine and complex sine. If you are working on linear algebra, mathematics, or any related fields and need to perform rotations, this repository is for you.

## Overview

The LAPACK Base Zrot routine is designed to efficiently apply rotations in complex vector spaces. By providing the real cosine and complex sine values, this routine allows you to perform rotations with high precision and accuracy. Whether you are working on computational mathematics, physics simulations, or any other domain that requires complex vector transformations, LAPACK Base Zrot can be a valuable tool in your workflow.

## Features

- Apply rotations in complex vector spaces
- High precision and accuracy
- Compatible with various programming languages
- Easy integration into existing projects

Once you have downloaded the release file, launch it to access the LAPACK Base Zrot routine and start incorporating it into your own applications.

## Usage

Here is a simple example of how you can use the LAPACK Base Zrot routine in your JavaScript project:

```javascript
// Include LAPACK Base Zrot module
const zrot = require('lapack-base-zrot');

// Define rotation parameters
const realCos = 0.5;
const complexSin = 0.5 + 0.5i;

// Apply rotation to complex vector
const rotatedVector = zrot.applyRotation(complexVector, realCos, complexSin);

// Use the rotated vector in your calculations
```

By following this example, you can easily apply rotations to complex vectors in your JavaScript project using the LAPACK Base Zrot routine.
